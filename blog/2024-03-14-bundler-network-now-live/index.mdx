## Decentralized & Censorship Resistant AA

One year ago marked a significant milestone with the launch of the first production-ready 
ERC-4337 entrypoint contract, with the premise of decentralized Account Abstraction 
using an alternative mempool. The limitations and vulnerabilities of centralized server 
approaches for smart accounts highlighted the importance of building decentralized and 
censorship-resistant solutions. ERC-4337 offers a permissionless bundler network to deliver 
UserOperations without even changing or censoring them. Bundlers are incentivized to 
participate in the service. They are also protected against grieving attacks thanks 
to the Entrypoint design. The network is protected from Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks 
ensuring continuous operation and resilience. The shared mempool was developed collaboratively 
with engineering teams from Candide, [ERC-4337](https://www.erc4337.io/), [Etherspot](https://etherspot.fyi/), 
[Silus](https://silius.gitbook.io/silius) and Alchemy.

## How does ERC-4337 achieve that?


The lack of proper measures can lead to various attacks, denial of service vectors,
and potential network failure. To create a robust solution, ERC-4337 is designed to separate 
validation from execution, limits the amount of work required for validation, and prevents 
certain environment opcodes during validation. Additionally, restrictions are placed on 
storage access and transactions to prevent mass invalidations and mutually exclusive 
transactions. These measures aim to maintain decentralization and prevent potential attacks 
on the network. A separate standard, ERC-7562 describes the rules imposed on the validation 
context of Account Abstraction transactions.


## Getting Started

Candide is proud to release its first p2p implementation for 
[Voltaire](https://github.com/candidelabs/voltaire/), marking a significant 
milestone into its operation in the permissionless mempool. With the introduction of the p2p 
implementation, Voltaire's codebase is now both in Python & Rust. UserOperations propagated 
to the mempool are routed not only solely to Voltaire but are also distributed to participating 
Bundlers that have completed the p2p implementation as of today: Etherspot's 
[Skandha](https://github.com/etherspot/skandha/) and [Silus](https://github.com/silius-rs/silius).

Smart Account Developers eager to get early access can simply

desired network for support.
